Image Color Proportions Summarize

This notebook was built by me, for a PhD student in immunology at Ben-Gurion University. The goal is to calculate percentages of 2 main colours (or more) relative to images of Cells (biology). The images format must be TIF, JPG, BMP and more images formats. And the notebook exports the data to an excel file and a summary image.
