Image Color Proportions Summarize

This notebook was built by me, for a doctoral student in immunology at Ben-Gurion University. The goal is to calculate percentages of 2 main colours (or more) relative to images of cells. The images must be in TIF, JPG, BMP and more formats. And the software exports the data to an excel file as well as a summary image.
